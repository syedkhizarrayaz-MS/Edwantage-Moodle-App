# cordova-plugin-media-capture (fork)

This is a fork of `cordova-plugin-media-capture` by [Moodle HQ](https://moodle.com/). If you are looking for the documentation, you can read the original at [apache/cordova-plugin-media-capture](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-media-capture).

## Modifications from the original

We created this fork because we needed to remove the READ_MEDIA_IMAGES and READ_MEDIA_VIDEO removed from the project. These permissions were removed in the master branch, but the new version hasn't been released yet. Once 6.0.0 is released, this fork will no longer be used.

## Installation

You can install this package using the [original installation instructions](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-media-capture), but installing this package instead:

```sh
cordova plugin add @moodlehq/cordova-plugin-media-capture@5.0.0-moodle.1
```
